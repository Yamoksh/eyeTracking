The objective of this project is to develop a robust automated algorithm for real time pupil and iris detection with high recognition rates in varying environment. First, Haar cascade based algorithm has been applied for fast and simple face detection from the input image. Then the eyes are extracted from the face and apply the algorithm for deciding left and right eye. After that, the pupil is extracted from both left and right image of eye by leveraging the property of black intensity distribution. Parallel, the iris candidates are extracted by using the new designed filter of size 5 X 5. Costs of each iris candidates are calculated. Finally, the iris candidates are paired up and the cost of each possible pairing is computed by a combination of mathematical models. After that, these irises pair will be treat as information for system to continue the tracking it in the continuous frame. The novelty of this work is that the algorithm works on complex low resolution images without constraints on the background or surrounding lighting. This algorithm has achieved high success rate of automatically iris recognition when the system has more online based positive example that generated during the tracking process under user friendly real time environment.
